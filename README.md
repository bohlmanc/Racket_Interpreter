# Racket Interpreter

To run: Must use a Linux machine
 - Run the command "make" at the command line to create the appropriate Makefile. 
 - Run the command "./interpreter < interpreter-test.input.XX", where XX is the number of the file you wish to test

In the future: May create a command-line functionality like the Python interpreter.

Thank you so much!!
